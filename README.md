# desktopwallpaper

An Electron app, bootstrapped by electron-forge, uses VueJS/Vuex for the view.

# description

Main purpose is to act as a desktop wallpaper. This is accomplished by fetching images from various booru-sites (image boards) with user-defined tags.

Other features include:
- Internet Radio
- Timers
- Save wallpaper into favorites
- Save favorites into disk
- Put clipboard url as a wallpaper

Previously it also had the ability to add sticky notes, but that fell out of use and removed due to bloat.
